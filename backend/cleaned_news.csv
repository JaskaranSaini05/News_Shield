Trump picks 'Death by China' author for trade advisory role,"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump named Peter Navarro, an economist who has urged a hard line on trade with China, to head a newly formed White House National Trade Council, the transition team said on Wednesday. Navarro is an academic and one-time investment adviser who has authored a number of popular books and made a film describing Chinaâ€™s threat to the U.S. economy as well as Beijingâ€™s desire to become the dominant economic and military power in Asia. Trumpâ€™s team praised Navarro in a statement as a â€œvisionaryâ€ economist who would â€œdevelop trade policies that shrink our trade deficit, expand our growth, and help stop the exodus of jobs from our shores.â€ Trump, a Republican, made trade a centerpiece of his presidential campaign and railed against what he said were bad deals the United States had made with other countries. He has threatened to hit Mexico and China with high tariffs once he takes office on Jan. 20. Navarro, 67, is a professor at University of California, Irvine, and advised Trump during the campaign. His books include â€œDeath by China: How America Lost its Manufacturing Base,â€ which was made into a documentary film. As well as describing what he sees as Americaâ€™s losing economic war with China, Navarro has highlighted concerns over environmental issues related to Chinese imports and the theft of U.S. intellectual property. China is paying close attention to Trumpâ€™s transition team and the possible direction of policy, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said after being asked about Navarroâ€™s appointment. â€œCooperation is the only correct choice. We hope the U.S. works hard with China to maintain the healthy, stable development of ties, including business and trade ties,â€ the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, told a daily press briefing. While Trump in the statement praised the â€œclarityâ€ of Navarroâ€™s arguments and the â€œthoroughness of his research,â€ few other economists have endorsed Navarroâ€™s ideas.  Marcus Noland, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, likened a tax and trade paper authored by Navarro and Wilbur Ross, who has been named as Trumpâ€™s commerce secretary, to â€œthe type of magical thinking best reserved for fictional realitiesâ€ for what he said was its flawed economic analysis. Navarro has also suggested a stepped-up engagement with Taiwan, including assistance with a submarine development program. He argued that Washington should stop referring to the â€œone Chinaâ€ policy, but stopped short of suggesting it should recognize Taipei, saying: â€œThere is no need to unnecessarily poke the Panda.â€ China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control.  Chinaâ€™s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in an interview carried on Thursday in the Communist Party of Chinaâ€™s official newspaper that China-U.S. relations face new uncertainties but with mutual respect for core interests they will remain stable. â€œOnly if China and the United States respect each other and give consideration to otherâ€™s core interests and key concerns can there be long-term, stable cooperation, and effect win-win mutual benefit,â€ Wang said. After his Nov. 8 election win, Trump stoked Chinaâ€™s ire when he took a telephone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in a break with decades of precedent that cast doubt on his incoming administrationâ€™s commitment to Beijingâ€™s â€œone Chinaâ€ policy. In an opinion piece in Foreign Policy magazine in November, Navarro and another Trump adviser, Alexander Gray, reiterated the president-electâ€™s opposition to major trade deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). â€œTrump will never again sacrifice the U.S. economy on the altar of foreign policy by entering into bad trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, allowing China into the World Trade Organization, and passing the proposed TPP,â€ Navarro and Gray wrote.  â€œThese deals only weaken our manufacturing base and ability to defend ourselves and our allies.â€ Trump has vowed to pull the United States out of the TPP, a free-trade pact aimed at linking a dozen Pacific Rim nations that President Barack Obama signed in February. It has not been ratified by the U.S. Senate.  The president-elect has also vowed to renegotiate the NAFTA pact with Canada and Mexico, saying it had cost American jobs. ",1
U.S. Senate confirms Haley as Trump's U.N. ambassador,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted almost unanimously on Tuesday to confirm South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as ambassador to the United Nations, sending a rising Republican star to represent President Donald Trump at an institution he has criticized. Haley was backed by 96 senators, with only four opposed. She impressed lawmakers during her confirmation hearing this month. Haley, 45, promised to press for U.N. reforms but also fight for human rights and support international institutions, often breaking from Trumpâ€™s positions. â€œAmerican values that we all hold dear and want to promote around the world are things that she has the ability to communicate and cares deeply about,â€ said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker. The â€œNoâ€ votes came from Democratic Senators Tom Udall, Chris Coons and Martin Heinrich, and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. â€œLike many Americans, and many of our allies, I am concerned about President Trumpâ€™s erratic statements and positions on foreign policy, and that concern is only deepened by the fact that his nominee to be ambassador to the United Nations has no real diplomatic experience,â€ Udall said. Haley has only held office in the state where she has been governor since 2011. The daughter of immigrants from India, Haley attracted national attention in 2015 when she secured the removal of the Confederate battle flag from South Carolinaâ€™s capitol grounds after a white supremacist killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston. She did not endorse Trump during last yearâ€™s presidential primaries and has warned that some of his most inflammatory statements promoted hate. During her confirmation hearing, Haley seconded criticism of the 193-nation organization by Trump and many of their fellow Republicans. She called for a close look at U.S. spending on the United Nations and blasted what she called its bias against Israel. Washington provides 22 percent of the U.N. budget. The United States and its frequent rivals Russia and China all hold permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, along with U.S. allies Britain and France. Haley won plaudits at her hearing for promising to stand up to Russia and agreeing that its actions, including bombing hospitals in Syria, should be considered war crimes. Haley was easily approved earlier on Tuesday by the 21-member Foreign Relations Committee. Haley is only the fourth confirmed member of Trumpâ€™s Cabinet, joining Defense Secretary James Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo. Unusually, Trumpâ€™s pick for secretary of state was not confirmed before his U.N. ambassador. His choice, former Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, faced unanimous opposition from the 10 Foreign Relations Committee Democrats after a confirmation hearing at which they said he seemed poorly prepared. The full, Republican-led Senate is expected to confirm Tillerson early next week. Haley is due to be sworn in on Wednesday. She is being succeeded as South Carolinaâ€™s governor by Republican Lieutenant Governor Henry McMaster. ",1

"Trump plan to slash State, foreign aid spending has foes in Congress","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposal to slash funding for the State Department and foreign aid faces stiff opposition in Congress, which must pass any spending plan, not just from Democrats, but also from many of his fellow Republicans. Trump administration officials said on Monday they sought to  increase Pentagon spending and offset that with sharp cuts in other areas. One official familiar with discussions about the State Department budget said the agency could see spending cut by as much as 30 percent. Other officials have speculated that the total cut in the combined budgets of the State Department and the Agency for International Development could be as great as 37 percent. â€œI am very concerned by reports of deep cuts that could damage efforts to combat terrorism, save lives and create opportunities for American workers,â€ said U.S. Representative Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee. Royce said his panel would â€œthoroughly reviewâ€ the budget request when Trump sends it to Congress. The United States spends just over $50 billion annually on the State Department and foreign assistance, compared with $600 billion or more each year on the Pentagon. But the administrationâ€™s proposals are just the start of negotiations on a federal budget that must be passed by Congress. Several leading lawmakers said diplomacy and foreign aid, often called â€œsoft power,â€ ensure national security in tandem with military forces and weapons.Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he discussed the issue with Trumpâ€™s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, at a meeting on Tuesday and planned to discuss it in greater detail after the White House submits its budget. Asked on Tuesday if the Senate would pass a budget that cuts the State Department budget by a third, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded, â€œprobably not.â€ Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate subcommittee responsible for the State and Foreign Aid budgets, said Trumpâ€™s idea would be â€œdead on arrivalâ€ in Congress. â€œIt would be a disaster. If you take soft power off the table, then youâ€™re never going to win the war. Whatâ€™s most disturbing about the cut in the State Departmentâ€™s budget, it shows a lack of understanding of what it takes to win the war,â€ he said on MSNBC. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said it was shortsighted to cut diplomacy and aid, even though he wants $640 billion in defense spending, far more than the $604 billion proposed by the White House. â€œIâ€™m very much opposed,â€ McCain told reporters when asked for his view of proposed State Department and aid cuts. â€œSo many of those programs are very important. Theyâ€™re a popular target, but theyâ€™re very important.â€ Senator Marco Rubio, a member of both the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees, noted that foreign aid is a tiny portion of the U.S. budget. â€œForeign aid is not charity. We must make sure it is well spent, but it is less than 1% of budget & critical to our national security,â€ he said on Twitter. The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ben Cardin, said he thought enough members of Congress would oppose such a plan to kill it, even though Republicans have  majorities in both houses of Congress and a budget bill would need only a simple majority to pass.  Trump was due to set out proposals for his broad agenda in a speech to Congress at 9 p.m. on Tuesday (0200 GMT Wednesday).  ",1

"After U.S. visit, South Sudan's Kiir orders unhindered aid access","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - South Sudan s President Salva Kiir has ordered that humanitarian aid convoys be allowed to move freely, unhindered and unimpeded around the country, two weeks after the United States said it had lost trust in his government and threatened to pull support. The Nov. 9 order, seen by Reuters, directs that all roadblocks should be removed, all levels of government must assist aid groups, and anyone who obstructs aid or imposes taxes on aid convoys shall be held accountable.  The move came two weeks after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley met with Kiir in Juba. She was the first member of President Donald Trump s cabinet to visit South Sudan, which spiraled into civil war in late 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan. Haley said Washington had lost trust in Kiir s government for fueling the civil war, and demanded that Kiir allow full and consistent humanitarian aid access.  This is a good sign, but we must see actions - more than words from President Kiir,  Haley said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to the Nov. 9 presidential order.  The true test will be whether humanitarian assistance is actually allowed to get to the South Sudanese people in a consistent way. We will be watching, and we will continue to encourage President Kiir to do the right thing,  she said. Haley s office said Kiir had yet to deliver on further commitments made during a 45-minute, one-on-one meeting with Haley in Juba.    The war in South Sudan, sparked by a feud between Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar, has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine. Some 4 million people have fled their homes, a third of the country s population. U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for South Sudan, Alain Noudehou, welcomed Kiir s Nov. 9 order.   We hope that the order will have a positive impact in reducing the many constraints faced by humanitarian partners that delay or prevent the provision of urgently needed help,  Noudehou said in a statement on Monday. This was not the first time Kiir has pledged to improve the humanitarian aid situation.  When U.N. Security Council ambassadors visited in September 2016, Kiir agreed to eliminate illegal checkpoints and streamline bureaucratic processes and access to people in need. The following month he set up a high-level humanitarian oversight committee to improve cooperation with aid groups. Yet U.N. sanctions monitors, in a report to the U.N. Security Council seen by Reuters last week, have accused Kiir s government of using food as a weapon of war to target civilians by blocking life-saving aid in some areas. They found that armed forces, groups and militias - particularly those affiliated with Kiir and Vice President Taban Deng Gai - continued to  actively impede both humanitarian and peacekeeping operations.  In his Nov. 9 order, Kiir directed the high-level humanitarian oversight committee ensure the aid convoys and groups can move freely and that state-level oversight committees be created. ",1

 These Words From Trumpâ€™s Own Mouth OBLITERATE His â€˜Outreachâ€™ To Women (VIDEO),"Donald Trump must think women are stupid. Recently, the billionaire s campaign revealed what they pretend is a comprehensive plan to help struggling families after the birth of a child.Sure, Trump has a long and storied history of making sexist remarks about women and generally treating them like trash, but now that he wants to be President, he s going to provide maternity leave. Of course, his plan is not quite all he and his cohorts pretend it to be.First off, men are left out entirely. Sure, it s 2016 when sometimes women work and men take care of the children, or there might be a couple of guys bringing a child into the world through one method or another. Trump s plan, which proposes six weeks of maternity leave and tax credits for stay-at-home mothers, serves only to reinforce the stereotype that a woman s place is in the home cooking dinner and raising the kids and the man s place is to go out and serve as breadwinner. Stay-at-home fathers, in Trump s world, do not exist and should not even be considered for any tax credits and benefits.Part of the problem is that Trump was famously uninvolved in raising his own children. I won t do anything to take care of them,  he told Howard Stern in 2005.  I ll supply funds and she ll take care of the kids. It s not like I m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park. Men simply do not raise children, or so Trump thinks. And, of course, it s probably best to let him think that in case he spawns more. Can you imagine how much more f*cked up his kids would be if he took a direct role in raising them?Of course, his thoughts on pregnant women in the workplace aren t very nice, either. In a 2004 interview with Dateline NBC,  the billionaire explained that while pregnancy is  a wonderful thing for the woman  and her  husband  (the idea of male same-sex couples does not enter into his mind, of course) it s  an inconvenience for the business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business,  he concluded, adding that women  should  feel like they will be replaced if they do not return to work quickly even if they will not necessarily be replaced.Watch Trump trash female employees who have the audacity to get pregnant below: Featured image via screen capture",0

Kansas governor signs school funding bill aimed at adequacy,"(Reuters) - Kansas Governor Sam Brownback on Thursday signed into law a school funding bill that will face scrutiny by the state supreme court to determine if it fulfills a mandate for adequacy. The Republican governor said he approved the measure even though the legislature â€œmissed an opportunity to substantially improve the K-12 funding system.â€ The Republican-controlled legislature faced a June 30 deadline set by the Kansas Supreme Court in March to come up with enough funding to meet the state constitutionâ€™s requirement for adequacy. Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts that filed a funding lawsuit, said the additional $293 million lawmakers allocated to schools over the next two fiscal years falls far short of what is needed. â€œWeâ€™re grateful for the effort, but itâ€™s not enough to achieve constitutionality,â€ he said, noting that the Kansas State Board of Education had proposed an $893 million, two-year funding increase. Now that the bill has become law, Rupe said he expects the supreme court to set up a process for the state to demonstrate how the measure complies with the constitutional requirement.  Besides finding more money for schools, Kansas lawmakers also had to plug budget holes largely caused by falling tax revenue. Earlier this month, the legislature overrode Brownbackâ€™s veto of a bill hiking income tax rates to raise $1.2 billion over the next two fiscal years. ",1
" While Honoring Native American Code Talkers, Trump Called Elizabeth Warren â€˜Pocahontasâ€™ (VIDEO)","Former reality show star Donald Trump just can t stop using a slur to describe Sen.

Trump was literally surrounded by Native Americans when he hurled the slur. The chief. He s the general and the chief,  Trump said during the White House event, in reference to White House chief of staff John Kelly.  I said, how good were these code talkers? He said, sir, you have no idea. You have no idea how great they were, what they have done for this country and the strength and the bravery and the love for the country. So that was the ultimate statement from General Kelly, the importance,  Trump continued.  And I just want to thank you because you re very, very special people.

But we can t find any evidence that it s true.channel4 reported:President Clinton appears to be blurring two different concepts when he talks about a  murder rate of Muslims  compared to  the native-born . He is confusing religion with immigration status here, and the two groups are not mutually exclusive. Clearly, you can be a native-born American Muslim. So it s not absolutely clear what he means, but we can only presume from the context that he is saying Muslims   perhaps Muslim immigrants specifically   are less likely to murder people than others.There are two official sources of national homicide statistics in the US: the FBI and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Neither of these organisations records the religion of the offender. So it s not possible to construct a  murder rate of Muslims  from official figures.So did Clinton just read this and deduce what he wanted to or did some low level staffer offer this as fact? we ll probably never know but this calls attention to the blithering BS that the Clinton grifters dole out on a regular basis.

"5 BIG LIES THE LEFTY MEDIA TOLD THIS WEEKâ€¦Then The Truth On Trump, Comey And Russia","We have very few favorites when it comes to reporting for obvious reasons: They lie all the time! Who hasn t read or heard something totally false about Trump and Russia? This past week was a banner week of lies from the main stream media so it s our pleasure to straighten things out for everyone We ve discovered a star news reporting organization that stands above most others in their reporting on the Trump/Russia investigation. CIRCA NEWS with Sara Carter and John Solomon are setting the record straight!Here s the skinny on the latest media lies and the truth via Circa:Aggressive news reporting can be a public service, like when courageous journalists exposed Richard Nixon s Watergate, the Catholic church s cover up of the sexual abuse and the U.S. intelligence failures that preceded 9-11.But breathless, half-baked reporting in times of tumult can also misserve the public, like when The Wall Street Journal retracted a false story that Bill Clinton had been seen in a compromising position with an intern in the White House or when NBC wrongly identified Richard Jewell as the Olympic Park bombing suspect.This past week, professional journalism offered us several new examples of breathless reporting during the brouhaha over Donald Trump, James Comey and Russia intelligence. At their least, some stories misled the public, and at their worst they outright misinformed.Here are some examples this week that should cause the media to search whether its current standards are doing enough to ensure the public gets the whole truth. You can review the facts and decide for yourself whether the media shamed itself.The Rosenstein  Quitting Episode The Washington Post reported Wednesday night that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had  threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey. The story cited an unnamed source close to the White House. But it did not have any comment or confirmation from the man who was alleged to have made the threat.When Sinclair Broadcast Group s Michelle Macaluso finally caught up to Rosenstein, a funny thing happened. He debunked the story. No, I m not quitting,  he said.The reporter pressed on:  Did you threaten to quit? No,  Rosenstein said.The Post did not return a call for comment Friday on whether it stood by its story.The Comey resources requestThe New York Times and several other outlets reported Wednesday that Comey, just before he was fired, had asked the Justice Department s Rosenstein for more funding and personnel for the Russia intelligence probe. But when Comey s deputy got to Capitol Hill the next day, he denied there was any need for more resources. I believe we have the adequate resources to do it and I know that we have resourced that investigation adequately,  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe told lawmakers.McCabe said the FBI, if it needed more resources, wouldn t even go to the Justice Department but instead to Congress.  We don t typically request resources for an individual case,  he explained.CNN s claim that Trump  is under investigation During the breaking story on Comey Tuesday night, respected CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin declared the FBI director s firing was a  grotesque abuse of power  and that it was a  political act when the President is under investigation. Toobin is entitled to his opinion but he should have the right facts. Numerous sources confirm to Circa that Comey told Congress just last week that Trump is NOT a target of the Russia probe.CNN s connection of grand jury subpoenas to Comey s firingCNN went live with an exclusive the night Comey was fired, reporting that grand jury subpoenas were issued to associates of former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn seeking business records in the Russia case.But with one slight turn of hand, CNN s legitimate scoop was crafted to suggest there had been some correlation to Comey s firing. CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey,  the network reported.The multitude of media comparisons to WatergateCountless media outlets from Politico and The New York Times to Mother Jones have suggested the whole Russia scandal is akin to Watergate, right down to Comey s firing mirroring Nixon s efforts to axe the special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.There s just one problem with that. Nixon was the target of the Watergate probe and he was accused of specific crimes.Via: Circa New/John Solomon",0

 BREAKING: Jeb Bush Suspends Campaign Under Pressure From Supporters Of Fellow GOPers,"Jeb Bush was originally the annointed one for the GOP Presidential nomination. However, Donald Trump turned the whole race upside down, and Bush never made it out of the single digits. As the South Carolina Primary draws to a close with yet another poor showing in what is widely seen as one of the most important primaries of the election season, supporters of other GOP candidates urge Bush to drop out. Florida Senator Tim Scott, who is backing Marco Rubio, says of Bush s candidacy and how it affects the GOP s chances at the White House: It s hard to tell you what the Bush camp is thinking. He served as a great governor. I think it d be a great opportunity for him to bring his folks over to the Rubio camp. But the reality is everyone who is running wants to do something good for America, so the question is, once you realize that s not going to happen, what do you do next? It s hard to answer that question unless you re the candidate. Sen. Scott wasn t the only one to call for Bush s withdrawal from the race. His fellow struggling GOP candidate John Kasich had his campaign put out the idea that tonight it became a four-person race  between Trump, Kasich, Rubio, and Cruz. John Kasich strategist and supporter John Weaver said of the South Carolina outcome: Only four candidates have top-three finishes in any of the early states and can justify staying in. At the same time, John Kasich has now won the so-called  Governors Bracket  by continuing to run strong and beat expectations. While others were making their last stand in South Carolina, John Kasich strengthened his organization and support   despite being outspent by tens of millions of dollars. The pressure worked, as Bush has suspended his campaign. So long, Jeb.God bless America indeed.Featured image via Soda Head",0
 Bill Maher Acts Out Trump SOTU Address And PERFECTLY Shows Trump Canâ€™t Ever Be POTUS (VIDEO),"Imagining what Donald Trump would be like as the next president of the United States is terrifying for every level-headed American. In fact, most of us don t even want to think about what it would be like.Bill Maher gave us an awful dose of reality on Real Time last night, when he imagined what a State of the Union address from the current Republican presidential front runner might look like. The enactment was prefaced with Maher pointing out the irony of Trump s complaints that former Mexican President Vicente Fox had used foul language to fire back at him after he pledged to make Mexico pay for the construction of his beloved U.S.-Mexico border wall if he became president. Fox s amazing response to that was  I m not going to pay for the f*cking wall  and he refused to comply when Trump demanded an apology for the comment.Amused with Trump s complete lack of self-awareness, Maher quipped on his show: Donald Trump must admit that, of all his reversals, hypocrisies, and 180s, his condemnation this week of Vicente Fox for using foul language is the most ridiculous of all. Talk about the pot calling the kettle orange. As Maher rolls footage of the Republican front runner cursing in several public speeches, the fact that Trump is pretending to be offended by Fox becomes even more hilarious.Maher then moved on to tackle Trump s disturbing popularity with the use of his alias,  Andrew Dice Trump . Maher commented that the reason Trump had risen so high was because voters like his crass way of speaking. Maher remarked, They kind of like it when a politician drops the facade and talks the way we all really talk. And to explore just what a future Trump presidency might look like, Maher acted out a State of The Union address to show just how political discourse could go if America doesn t wake up soon and realize that we re better than bigotry and outlandish comments. Assuming the position of Trump in the scene, Maher cursed his entire way through the distasteful address and announced that  the state of our union is f*cking awesome. Sadly, Maher captured Trump perfectly and this is probably a very realistic representation of what a speech by President Trump might look like.

Senator Feinstein doubts talks with Senator Cornyn to produce gun deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein said on Wednesday that she doubted talks with the Senateâ€™s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, would succeed in a deal on legislation to ban gun sales to people on terror watchlists. â€œI donâ€™t think that going to work out,â€ Feinstein told reporters, but added that she was still talking to other lawmakers in an effort to find agreement. She also said she understood that Cornyn had shared her draft legislation with the National Rifle Association.  â€œNow, that would do it,â€ she said, suggesting the gun lobby would reject her proposal.

"UNREAL! TWO FLORIDA Immigrant Politicians Intimidated Voters: â€œCandidates watched over their shoulders, telling them who to vote for.â€","Commissioner Mack Bernard and Rep. Al Jacquet, both Democrats running in the August primary, took advantage of gaping holes in Florida s vote-by-mail laws to pressure and cajole voters in their living rooms.In one case, a blind voter said Bernard filled out and signed his ballot. His vote counted, but Post reporters looked at the signature on the ballot envelope after the fact and found it didn t match the one on file. Florida law requires that absentee voters sign their own ballot. In other cases, residents said  Voters said they received mail-in ballots but didn t know why. One woman said she felt pressured by a persistent candidate who talked his way into her home and dug out her ballot from a stack of discarded mail.You get your ballot in the mail, no questions asked, vote from the comfort of your own home and send it back to the elections office. Sound great? But how do they know that you were the one who voted? Whether their tactics were allowed under Florida law is unclear. Elections experts had never heard of candidates filling out ballots and found the practice disturbing.Bernard and Jacquet, both lawyers who have been in politics since 2009, denied wrongdoing To argue that my hard-fought victory was achieved by anything other than the sweat on my brow and the lost sole on my shoes is offensive,  Bernard said.Read more: PBP",0
"Trump blasts 'criminal' leaks by intelligence agencies, calls Flynn 'wonderful'","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday assailed what he said were illegal and â€œcriminalâ€ leaks from U.S. intelligence agencies in the controversy over contacts with Russian officials that forced his national security adviser Michael Flynn to resign. Speaking at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump called Flynn a â€œwonderful manâ€ and added: â€œI think itâ€™s very, very unfair whatâ€™s happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally, I stress that, illegally leaked.â€ ",1
 Hotel Workers Smashed Trump In A MASSIVE Victory,"Bad news for Donald Trump! Despite his objections, workers at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, just delivered a huge f*ck you to The Donald with the assistance of the National Labor Relations Board. Since the employees voted to unionize in December, Trump has been fighting racist tooth and Islamophobic nail against the idea that workers deserve some modicum of self-determination   but it seems that even his  huge  hands were not enough to stop the NLRB from officially certifying the union.This comes after numerous dirty tricks, including the use of scare tactics and ironic attempts to convince the Board to throw out the workers  vote because employees were allegedly  intimidated  into agreeing to unionize in the first place. But, of course, it was Trump s goons doing the intimidating: They pressured us a lot [to vote no],  housekeeper Marisela Olvera told ThinkProgress.  They told us the union only wants our money, that if we supported the union we d lose our jobs, that the company would put our names on a blacklist and no other hotels in Las Vegas would hire us. They told us to think of what our children would do if we were out of work. Everyone was very stressed. People were afraid. But bendito sea Di s, we still won, even with all that pressure. Now, Think Progress reports that (with Trump s appeal going about as well as his attempts to win over anyone who isn t a white, straight Christian male) workers are demanding that management tuck its tail between its legs, sit down with them like adults, and work out a contract. We re just waiting for a contract,  housekeeper Maria Jaramillo told the publication.  We deserve one. We re not second-class workers. So we re here, waiting for him. Unfortunately, they may have to wait a while longer. Management says they intend to appeal the Labor Board s decision:Jaramillo and her coworkers then formed a bargaining committee, hoping that management would soon recognize their union and begin negotiating with them. But the Trump hotel signaled this week that they have no intention of doing so. We will continue our fight to ensure a fair election for our valued associates, many of whom vigorously oppose union representation,  said Jill Martin, an attorney for The Trump Organization, in a statement to reporters.  The hearing officer s recommendations erroneously disregarded the severe misconduct undertaken by Union agents, which clearly impacted an incredibly close election.  Trump management has until next week to formally challenge the NLRB recommendation, and then the Board s regional chapter will determine whether or not to certify the union. Even if the local board backs the workers, Trump can further delay by appealing their ruling to the federal board in Washington, D.C. Mr. Trump is a very good business man,  linens worker Rosebert Donato told ThinkProgress, apparently using a loose definition of both  good  and  businessman. Donoto hopes Trump will grow up, put on his big boy pants, and sit down to discuss things with the workers. He says he wants to make America great,  Olvera says.  Well, he should start here in his own house, his own business. He always brags about how he has millions and millions and millions of dollars, but he pays his workers less than most in Las Vegas.

Rep. Franks to resign after staff members' complaints of harassment,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Representative Trent Franks said on Thursday he would resign after two female staffers complained that he had discussed surrogacy with them. Franks, 60, who has been a member of Congress from Arizona since 2003, said in a statement that he would step down on Jan. 31. The House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Thursday it had opened an investigation into accusations of sexual harassment against Franks. The congressman said he was resigning because coverage of the committeeâ€™s investigation in the â€œcurrent cultural and media climateâ€ would â€œdamage those things I love most.â€ Franks said he and his wife had struggled with infertility and sought a surrogate in order to have another child after they had twins with a surrogate. â€œI have recently learned that the Ethics Committee is reviewing an inquiry regarding my discussion of surrogacy with two previous female subordinates, making each feel uncomfortable,â€ Franks said. â€œI deeply regret that my discussion of this option and process in the workplace caused distress,â€ he said. Franks denied he ever â€œphysically intimidated, coerced, or had, or attempted to have, any sexual contact with any member of my congressional staff.â€ U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan was briefed on the allegations on Nov. 29 and urged Franks to resign in a conversation the following day, Ryanâ€™s office said in a statement. â€œThe speaker takes seriously his obligation to ensure a safe workplace in the House,â€ the statement said. Franks, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, represents Arizonaâ€™s 8th Congressional District, a mainly suburban area of Phoenix. He won re-election in 2016 with 68.5 percent of the vote. Republican President Donald Trump carried the district by 21 points last year.  Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey will call a special election to fill the seat. The nominating primary must be held between 80 and 90 days after the vacancy and the general election must be conducted 50 to 60 days after the primary, according to state law. Numerous prominent men in U.S. politics, media and entertainment have been accused in recent months of sexual harassment and misconduct.  Earlier on Thursday, Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota said he would resign in a few weeks following allegations of sexual misconduct. U.S. Democratic Representative John Conyers of Michigan resigned on Tuesday after accusations of sexual harassment were leveled against him. Conyers denied the allegations, while Franken said some of the accusations against him were untrue and he remembered other incidents differently from his accusers. Reuters has not verified the allegations against either man. ",1
